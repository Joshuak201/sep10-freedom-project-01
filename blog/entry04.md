### Content
 For this unit, the class has been browsing and navigating tools that will make the end of the year freedom project easier and the process of creating a webpage about our chosen topic much easier. Three of the many tools we've browsed that interested me were A-frame, SASS, and jQuery. But, out of these three tools, I decided to choose A-frame. I've decided to choose A-frame because of the sheer simplicity and ease that it takes to navigate. A-frame drew my interest because of how easy it is to create 3D domains with only a few lines of raw HTML code. And I believe that adding these 3D elements can allow my webpage to stick out and emphasize the creativity that A-frame can bring to my project.

### Reflection
 Being that A-frame is so easy to use, it would make the process of creating my webpage simpler to accomplish and not as hard as it normally would be. The only  problem that seems to be happening while learning A-frame is that it's new to me. So, over the past few weeks, I have been navigating A-frame and learning the fundamentals of A-frame and I look forward to using much more in class. Other than that, A-frame has been pretty exciting and engaging to use for me.

 Pickcode and Youtube helped me the most because in pickcode, it allowed me to tinker with A-frame code and make my own elements. Like shown in the example in the EDP section, pickcode allows the user to create their own A-frame code lines. Youtube helped me because I was able to search tutorials and you can learn from people follow A-frame. I also can use youtbe to correct errors that I've made.

 This is the original A-frame code. I tinkered with this code by altering colors and adding another shape. I experimented with some colors and got more comfortable with the a-frane HTML code lines. This is my tinkered version :

### Skills
 Finally, A-frame has been a learning experience, helping me to learn new lines of code. This will allow me to bring my webpage to the next level, allowing me to create 3d elements and making interactions thats unique to me. Learning this will help me to add newly found code into my project and expand my horizon of HTML code lines. A-frame taught me a new code line that can bring out future project, making them stand out to viewers.
